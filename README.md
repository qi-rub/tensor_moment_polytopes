The moment polytopes of the orbits closures of all tensors of shape 3x3x3, of some tensors in 4x4x4, and of many homogenous cubic forms (symmetric tensors of order three) of 3 and 4 variables.

See our paper [Computing moment polytopes — with a focus on tensors, entanglement and matrix multiplication](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.08336) for details.

A reference implementation will be made available at a later time. 

These results were presented at STOC 2025. Extended abstract is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3717823.3718221).
